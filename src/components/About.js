      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm passionate about web development and currently focused on honing my skills in Java, MERN stack, and Data Structures & Algorithms. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies that can enhance my development journey.
      </p>

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        Apart from coding, I'm deeply interested in diving into the world of data structures and algorithms. Solving complex problems and optimizing code is something that really excites me. Additionally, I find myself captivated by the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and its capabilities in building powerful and dynamic web applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        In my free time, you'll often find me immersed in coding challenges or working on personal projects. I also enjoy reading tech blogs and articles to stay updated with the latest trends in web development. When I'm not coding, I like to unwind by exploring nature, going on hikes, and capturing moments through photography.
      </p>

      <h3>Studies</h3>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing my studies in VIT vellore. This academic journey has not only broadened my understanding of various concepts but also provided a strong foundation for my technical endeavors.
